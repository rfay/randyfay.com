translatableregions adds the ability for the user to machine-translate
specific regions which you specify as CSS selectors.

Installation
------------

Copy the translatableregions folder to your sites/all/modules directory, 
then enable it at Administer > Modules.

Configure the CSS selectors for the regions that you want to work with at 
Administer > Configuration > Regional > Translatable Regions

If you want the user to be able to control whether the translate button
is shown, enable the associated block that allows it to be turned on or 
off.
